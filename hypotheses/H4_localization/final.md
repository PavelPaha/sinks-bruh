# H4 — Final (localization)

## Outcome
- status: `pending`

## Evidence
- heatmaps:
- layer profiles:

## Interpretation
- what “localization” means here (be conservative)
- whether it supports a mechanistic story (e.g., specific head types)

## Limitations / next experiments
- multiple comparisons (if we go formal)
- need for run-to-run stability checks
